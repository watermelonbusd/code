        <div>WatermelonBUSD is an easy to use investment platform built by a team of crypto enthusiasts active since
          2016. The purpose of this platform is to provide a ROI to active users, and drive conversion between the
          different WatermelonBUSD products that are improving the sustainability of the platform, creating a positive
          loop into the investments.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>The first product launched is a fixed BUSD 12% daily ROI investment platform. It has a very low minimum of
          10 BUSD of investment for its usage, allowing also trying the platform with small amounts. We decided to not
          go lower than 10BUSD minimum deposit in order to ensure the investor is not going to lose all the advantages
          of the platform in network fees. The deposit fees consists of a 8% going into marketing investment to further
          expand the platform user base and 2% to cover dev activities</div>
        <div>Also, to avoid having whales ruining the project, we limit the maximum investment to 5000 BUSD.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>The investment has a cap on ROI of 500%. At any time during the current investment, or after the maximum
          ROI is reached, a user can deposit a new amount into the platform to start a new cycle.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>The investment model of WatermelonBUSD requires rewards claiming every 24 hours, and the possibility to
          withdraw 50% of available rewards on a weekly basis. To differentiate WatermelonBUSD from other similar
          products, the withdrawal fee is just a little 1%, in order to help cover the dev activities.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>A useful and common way to expand the user base is to provide a referral advantage: in WatermelonBUSD this
          consists in a one time 10% reward on the amount invested by the referred person. This amount is not included
          in the maximum ROI calculation and can be withdrawn immediately.</div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>The contract is immutable and itâ€™s available for scan on <a
            href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xEBFDF7A84eB1DD651663782802A818ce36F3e18A#code">BSCScan</a></div>
        <div><br></div>
        <div>In the upcoming days a lottery will be added in order to expand the platform capabilities and maintain
          WatermelonBUSD sustainable in the long term. Any new platform feature is going to be detailed in this
          whitepaper. All contracts will be audited and details of the audit will be available through
          watermelonbusd.com and in this whitepaper.</div>
